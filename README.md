# Grafica-Pe-Calculator

University optional course for Computer Graphics in OpenGL, using mainly C++ and GLSL as well as standard libraries for the latest version of OpenGL. As a student using OpenGL at university, I work on simple 2D and 3D projects to learn the fundamentals of graphics programming. This hands-on experience is invaluable for helping me understand essential concepts like the rendering pipeline, transformations, and shaders, which form the backbone of modern computer graphics.

As for the Environment I'm using Microsoft Studio 2022, branding an OpenGL Template Glut, special used for the projects we're developing along each weekly laboratory. Presented below are specific task I've implemented in OpenGL.

Laboratory no. 2

1. Color different primitives using a switch case in the shader and as a plus they should change colors aleatory

2. Draw a front-facing triangle and a back-facing triangle using different rendering options. For example, the front-facing triangle should be drawn with the FILL option and shaded with a gradient, while the back-facing triangle should use a different option and be colored with a single, uniform color.

Laboratory no. 3

1. Choose 𝑎, 𝑏 > 100. Draw two polygons, P1 (convex) and P2 (concave), both positioned within the rectangle [0,a]×[0,b] (meaning the x-coordinates of the vertices are between 0 and a, and the y-coordinates are between 0 and b). For the concave polygon, use an appropriate triangulation for rendering.

2.The background should be a gradient.

3.Draw both P1 and P2, as well as the figure obtained by applying one of the following transformations: (a) rotation centered "between" P1 and P2, or (b) scaling along arbitrary axes. Specify how you implemented the composition of transformations – either by multiplying the matrices in the shader or by performing matrix multiplication in the main program.
